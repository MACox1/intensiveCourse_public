    "In this show, you can win a car, or you can win a goat.\n",
    "We assume that winning a car is desirable (you have a garage or can resell easily), and that winning a goat is not (too much hassle to host the goat even for selling it)\n",
    "\n",
    "You are presented with three closed doors: behind one of the doors there is the prize (the car), behind the other two doors there is a goat.\n",
    "\n",
    "The game proceeds like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "- You pick a door.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Monty Hall (who knows where the car is) will open a door, among the unchosen ones, that contains a goat.\n",
    "\n",
    "- You can now choose whether to keep your chosen door, or to switch to the other unopened door\n",
    "\n",
    "- Monty Hall now opens all the doors: if the car is behind your door of choice, you win it. Otherwise, you win a goat (and you don't want to)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** what's the best strategy for you? Should you always maintain your initial choice? Should you always switch door? Or maybe it doesn't matter?\n",
